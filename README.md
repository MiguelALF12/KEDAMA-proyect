## Project Status

> This project was initially deployed in heroku to showcase the ability to design and implement a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. It is currently not active, as the main goal was to demonstrate the acquisition of web development skills and concepts. The website served as a valuable learning tool and portfolio piece, demonstrating the application of CRUD operations, database interactions, and user interface design.

## Overview

This project is a simple sales management website designed to streamline the sales process for various types of products. It features comprehensive CRUD functionalities for managing products, clients, and sellers, alongside facilitating an easy purchase process. Built using the MERN stack, this full-stack project served as a practical demonstration of modern web development concepts, including database management, server-side scripting, and front-end development.
